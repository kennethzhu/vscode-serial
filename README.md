# Serial Monitor for VS Code

1. `Serial: Activate` Activate the extension
2. Select a serial device via either `Serial: Select` or the button in the status bar.
3. Open the selected port with `Serial: Open port` or toggle by clicking [plug/x].

Save config to `.vscode/serial.js` by running `Serial: Generate config`.
If you have a config file already saved in your workspace the extension will automaticly activate. This means that you don't have to run `Serial: Activate` which means `Serial: Open port` is available directly.
